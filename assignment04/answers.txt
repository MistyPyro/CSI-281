1. bubbleSort() is slower than selectionSort() and insertionSort() because bubbleSort() is very inefficient compared to selectionSort() and insertionSort().
   Even though they all have the same time complexity, the constants that are removed from the equation end up slowing bubbleSort() down.

2. An optimized insertionSort() is faster than selectionSort() because selectionSort() makes a lot more comparisons than an optimized insertionSort().

3. A custom class needs the property of "comparibility". The sorting algorithms compare each array spot, where it asks "is 3 > 4?" or "is 'banana' > 'soup'?".
   for a C++ class, you would need to implement overloads of the >, >=, <, and <= operators.

4. std::sort is so much faster because it is like a hybrid sorting algorithm. It chooses the best algorithm from its toolkit for the given data, instead of
   applying the same algorithm to all data.
