1. Jarnik's algorithm can be reworked to select the edge with the most weight instead of least weight to find the maximum-spanning tree.

2. A minimum-spanning tree is different because a solution to The Travelling Salesman problem is a path, while a minimum-spanning tree is a tree.

4. The time complexity is O((V + E)LogV) (where E is # of edges, V # of vertices) when a priority queue is used. Without a priority queue, the time complexity is O(V^2).
   There is a difference because of how a priority queue functions compared to the alternative

5. Jarnik's algorithm is a greedy algorithm because it picks the edge with the least weight at each step, being greedy by picking the best available option every time.

6. An algorithm is the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The purpose of the algorithm is to compute the shortest paths from a single vertex to all other vertices in a weighted digraph.
   I struggled to find documentation about it, but I believe that the name being Bellman-Ford is due to them having more popular publications over the original creator,
   Alfonso Shimbel.
